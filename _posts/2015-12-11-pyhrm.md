I recently played through the latest game from
[Tomorrow Corporation](http://tomorrowcorporation.com/):
Human Resource Machine.

![Human Resource Machine title screen](/images/hrm_title.png)

The game provides a friendly wrapper around a simplified kind of assembly
language programming, and presents challenges in the form of what are
essentially unit tests. Make the tests pass, and the level is complete.

The challenges start from the very basics and work up to some fairly complex
programs, like prime factorization and sorting arbitrary-length sequences.
It's not a terribly hard game for someone with a bit of low-level programming
experience -- I completed all the levels in a single day, though I didn't always
meet the optional objectives (program length and runtime).

If you haven't played the game, I recommend picking it up and giving it a shot.

## The setup

There are two cute features in the game that piqued my interest:

### 1: Hand drawn comments

As the challenges get more complicated, the game provides a cute system for
annotating your program in the form of a simple line drawing interface:

![line drawing interface](/images/hrm_label.png)

### 2: Textual program representation

The in-game program editor is very graphical, with drag and drop editing,
but programs can be copied and shared in a simple textual form. The game
provides buttons for copying and pasting as a simple way to import and export
programs.

Here's an example:

Notice the weird-looking blobs of text at the end. It's pretty clear that those
encode my beautiful hand drawn comments and labels in some way,
but I had no idea how.
My curiosity was piqued, so I started experimenting.

## Reverse engineering

I started by creating a few labels to test simple cases: empty drawings, and
single dot drawings at various known locations, like the center, corners,
and sides of the drawing region.

![test images](/images/hrm_test_labels.png)

[Note that the third drawing is actually a single dot in the top left corner,
but the in-game renderer seems to have a bug for this _corner_ case.]

The textual form of those labels is fairly informative:

	DEFINE COMMENT 0
	eJxjYBgFo2AUjGQAAAQEAAE;

	DEFINE COMMENT 1
	eJxjYmBgcCs3q2MYBaNgFIxIAADN+gF0;

	DEFINE COMMENT 2
	eJxjYmBg0GRYwTAKRsEoGJkAAE7pANQ;

	DEFINE COMMENT 3
	eJxjYWBg6M7k7QNSDLuqzyYwjIJRMApGFAAAwIMD9g;


Note how the labels all start with the same characters, and that the length of
the data seems to roughly match the complexity of the drawing it corresponds to.

At this point, I was pretty sure that the text blobs in the program file were
binary data in a base64 encoding. It's a common way to represent binary data in
text (see [CSS image data URIs](https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/)),
and after seeing many instances of base64'd data
one starts to get a sense of what the encoded result looks like.

So I wrote a quick script to base64 decode the blobs and save them to individual
binary files. I had to do a bit of hackery to fix the padding for the decoder,
but after a quick skim of
[the Wikipedia article on base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)
I got things working:


{% highlight python %}
import base64

def decode_hrm_drawing(text_blob):
    # strip ; terminator
    text_blob = text_blob[:-1]
    # add base64 padding
    if len(text_blob) % 4 != 0:
        text_blob += '=' * (2 - (len(text_blob) % 2))
    # decode base64
    return base64.decodestring(text_blob)

blobs = [
    'eJxjYBgFo2AUjGQAAAQEAAE;',
    'eJxjYmBgcCs3q2MYBaNgFIxIAADN+gF0;',
    'eJxjYmBg0GRYwTAKRsEoGJkAAE7pANQ;',
    'eJxjYWBg6M7k7QNSDLuqzyYwjIJRMApGFAAAwIMD9g;'
]

for i, blob in enumerate(blobs, start=1):
    with open('label%d.dat' % i, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(decode_hrm_drawing(blob))
{% endhighlight %}


Examining the resulting files with `hexdump` didn't reveal any secrets, so I
turned to an old standby:


{% highlight bash %}
$ file *.dat
label1.dat: zlib compressed data
label2.dat: zlib compressed data
label3.dat: zlib compressed data
label4.dat: zlib compressed data
{% endhighlight %}


Aha! That's why the files looked like noise, they were compressed! Thankfully,
that could be fixed with minimal changes to my script:


{% highlight python %}
import base64
import zlib

def decode_hrm_drawing(text_blob):
    text_blob = text_blob[:-1]
    if len(text_blob) % 4 != 0:
        text_blob += '=' * (2 - (len(text_blob) % 2))
    # decode base64 -> decode zlib
    return zlib.decompress(base64.decodestring(text_blob))
{% endhighlight %}


The newly decompressed files weren't identified by `file`, so it's back to
`hexdump`:


{% highlight bash %}
$ hexdump -C label2.dat
00000000  02 00 00 00 46 77 36 7e  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |....Fw6~........|
00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|
*
00000404
{% endhighlight %}


Now, we're getting somewhere. At this point I figured I should make a few more
simple drawings, including some lines of various lengths. I haven't included
them in this post to keep things readable, but they were useful in testing my
assumptions.

My first observation was that every file was the exact same length, regardless
of the complexity of the source drawing:


{% highlight bash %}
$ wc -c *.dat
1028 label1.dat
1028 label2.dat
1028 label3.dat
1028 label4.dat
4112 total
{% endhighlight %}


Counting the number of non-zero bytes shows that the contents are fairly
different, though (which explains the discrepancy in their compressed size):


{% highlight bash %}
$ tr -d '\0' <label1.dat | wc -c
0
$ tr -d '\0' <label2.dat | wc -c
5
$ tr -d '\0' <label3.dat | wc -c
3
$ tr -d '\0' <label4.dat | wc -c
9
{% endhighlight %}


Most binary formats have some sort of header, so I looked at the first few bytes
of each file and found what looked like an unsigned 32-bit integer which
corresponds to the number of dots in the drawing:


{% highlight bash %}
ls *.dat | xargs -n1 hexdump -C -n8
00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                           |........|
00000008
00000000  02 00 00 00 46 77 36 7e                           |....Fw6~|
00000008
00000000  02 00 00 00 29 00 a8 00                           |....)...|
00000008
00000000  04 00 00 00 8b 69 0d 8e                           |.....i..|
00000008
{% endhighlight %}


[I should note that I'm not sure if the header integer is signed or not, but considering the apparent 1028 byte size limitation, it's unlikely to matter.]

The first label is empty, so it's header is zero. The next two are single dots,
and their header numbers are both two. The last label has two dots, and a header
number of four. Using my line segment test labels, I figured out that the header
number must correspond to the total path length.

Armed with this knowledge, I worked out the format of the remaining data.
The non-zero data after the header in each file seemed to fit in `header * 4`
bytes. Since I knew that the data must be encoding a two-dimensional drawing,
and each 2-d coordinate requires two numbers, the most likely format seemed to
be pairs of short (16-bit) unsigned integers.

Working on that assumption, I updated my script once again:


{% highlight python %}
import base64
import numpy as np
import zlib

def decode_hrm_drawing(text_blob):
    text_blob = text_blob[:-1]
    if len(text_blob) % 4 != 0:
        text_blob += '=' * (2 - (len(text_blob) % 2))
    binary_data = zlib.decompress(base64.decodestring(text_blob))
    # Convert to numeric bytes with numpy
    byte_data = np.fromstring(binary_data, dtype=np.uint8)
    assert byte_data.shape == (1028,)
    header, = byte_data[:4].view(np.uint32)
    path = byte_data[4:4+4*header].view(np.uint16).reshape((-1,2))
    return path

for i, blob in enumerate(blobs, start=1):
    print 'label%d:' % i
    print decode_hrm_drawing(blob)
    print ''
{% endhighlight %}


Running this on our examples yields:

	label1:
	[]

	label2:
	[[30534 32310]
	 [    0     0]]

	label3:
	[[ 41 168]
	 [  0   0]]

	label4:
	[[27019 36365]
	 [    0     0]
	 [31674 24781]
	 [    0     0]]

Hooray, it works! From this it's pretty easy to see that the drawings are
stored as sequences of (x, y) coordinates, with (0, 0) in the top left corner
and (65536, 65536) in the bottom right corner.

[Note that 65536 = 2<sup>16</sup>, the largest unsigned 16-bit integer value.]

The last observation is that disconnected line segments are separated by a
(0, 0) coordinate. And that's it!

## The end result

With a complete understanding of the binary file format worked out, I expanded
my script to parse and render the drawings from a Human Resource Machine program
using Python's
[built-in `turtle` drawing library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html).
It's not particularly fast, but it does make a cool animated effect.

You can [check out the script here](https://github.com/perimosocordiae/pyhrm/blob/master/extract_images.py),
and try it on your programs or the example programs in that repository.
