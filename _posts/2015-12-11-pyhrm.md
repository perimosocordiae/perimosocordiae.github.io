  Blobs of unexplained data make me curious.

I recently played through the latest game from Tomorrow Corporation:
Human Resource Machine.

[Insert image here]

The game provides a friendly wrapper around a simplifed kind of assembly
language programming, and presents challenges in the form of what are
essentially unit tests. Make the tests pass, and the level is complete.

The challenges start from the very basics and work up to some fairly complex
programs, like prime factorization and sorting arbitrary-length sequences.
It's not a terribly hard game for someone with a bit of low-level programming
experience -- I completed all the levels in a single day, though I didn't always
meet both the optional objectives (program length and runtime) for all of them.

If you haven't played the game, I recommend picking it up and giving it a shot.

## The setup

There are two cute features in the game that piqued my interest:

### 1: Hand drawn comments

As the challenges get more complicated, the game provides a cute system for
annotating your program in the form of a simple line drawing interface:

### 2: Textual program representation

The in-game program editor is very graphical, with drag and drop editing,
but programs can be copied and shared in a simple textual form. The game
provides buttons for copying and pasting as a simple way to import/export
programs.

Here's an example:

	Insert pasted program here

Notice the weird-looking blobs of text at the end. It's pretty clear that those
encode my beautful hand drawn comments and labels, but I had no idea how. So,
naturally, I started experimenting.

## Reverse engineering

I started by creating a few labels to test simple cases: empty drawings, and
single dot drawings at various known locations, like the center, corners,
and sides of the drawing region.

[Insert image here]

The textual form of those labels was pretty informative:

	Insert paste here

Note how the labels all start with the same characters, and that the empty
drawing is shorter than the single-dot drawings, and that all the single-dot
drawings are the same length.

At this point, I was pretty sure that the text blobs in the program file were
binary data in a base64 encoding. It's a common way to represent binary data in
text (see CSS image data urls), and after seeing many instances of base64'd data
you start to get a sense of what the encoding looks like.

So I wrote a quick script to base64 decode the blobs and save them to individual
binary files. I had to do a bit of hackery to fix the padding for the decoder,
but a quick skim of the Wikipedia article on base64 got things working:

	Insert program here

Examining the resulting files with `hexdump` didn't reveal any secrets, so I
turned to an old standby:

	$ file label1.dat
	zlib-encoded file

Aha! That's why the files looked like noise, they were compressed! Thankfully,
that could be fixed with minimal changes to my script:

	Insert program here

The newly decompressed files weren't identified by `file`, so it's back to
`hexdump`:

	$ hexdump -C label1.dat
	TODO

Now, we're getting somewhere. At this point I figured I should make a few more
simple drawings:

[Insert image here: two dots, simple line]

My first observation is that every file was the exact same length, regardless
of the complexity of the source drawing:

	$ ls -l label*.dat
	TODO

Most binary formats have some sort of header, so I looked at the first few bytes
of each file and found what looked like an unsigned 32-bit integer which records
the number of line segments in the drawing:

	TODO

[I should note that I'm not sure if the header integer is signed or not, but considering the apparent 1028 byte size limitation, it's unlikely to matter.]

Using the path length from the header, I figured that the actual data
representing the line segments must be stored as 16-bit numbers. The non-zero
data after the header in each file seemed to fit in `path_len * 4` bytes, and
each coordinate in a path requires two numbers, so using short integers
seemed like the most likely approach.

Working on that assumption, I updated my script:

	TODO

Hooray, it works! The drawings are stored as sequences of (x, y) coordinates,
with (0, 0) in the top left corner and (65536, 65536) in the bottom right
corner. [Note that 65536 = 2^16, the largest unsigned 16-bit integer value.]

The last observation is that the lines are not all connected together, and a
quick look at the data shows that gaps in the drawing are noted by a (0, 0)
coordinate.

## The end result

With all of these discoveries in mind, I produced a complete Python script that
parses drawings from a Human Resource Machine prorgam and draws then using
Python's built-in `turtle` drawing library. It's not particularly fast, but it
does make a cool animated effect.

You can [check out the script here](https://github.com/perimosocordiae/pyhrm/blob/master/extract_images.py),
and try it on your programs or the example programs in that repository.
